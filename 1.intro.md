# First
*Selenium installation for node (with npm):*

```javascript 
npm install selenium-webdriver
npm install chromedriver -g
```

Then there's the JavaScript going (inside Node console):
```javascript
const selenium = require("selenium-webdriver");
const driver = new selenium.Builder().forBrowser("chrome").build();
const url = "https://onet.pl"

driver.get(url);
```

After that' you should see new browser window with info about automated software driven window.
To close you should insert:

```javascript
driver.close();
```

# Second
*First choice - selecting element by XPath:*

```javascript
const selenium = require("selenium-webdriver");
const driver = new selenium.Builder().forBrowser("chrome").build();
const url = "https://onet.pl"

driver.get(url);

#Class with static methods to search by some params
const By = selenium.By;

#Metoda na driverze, przyjmujaca statyczna funkcje z klasy By
const field = driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html/body/......."));
field.sendKeys("Found this element by explicit XPAth;");
```

# Third
*Be elastic - selecting element by ID*

```javascript
const chosenId = "yourID";
#Method for choosing by id
const form = driver.findElement(By.id(chosenId));

#Method returning promise with string for name
form.getTagName().then(name => console.log("Tag name is " + name););

#Method returning promise with height and width
form.getSize().then(size => console.dir(size));
```

# Fourth
*By class - more ways to locate elemtns*

Due to [documentation](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/index_exports_WebElementPromise.html) there's plenty of ways to select elements

# Fifth
*More then one - dealing with list of items*

First find parent element and then inside chosen element find element by another selector
```javascript
driver.findElement(By.id("parentID")).findElement(By.css("input")).clear().sendKeys("Found children input");
```

But there are some rules it's good to follow:
* The shorter the better - keep selectors as short as possible
* Non-ambiguous - most strict as hell
* Reliable - remember about fact that page is evolving

# Sixth
*Interact with me - do something with selected elements*
