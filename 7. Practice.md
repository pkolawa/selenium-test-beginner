# First
*Find donors - choosing websites you can make tests on*

Here are some example webpages you can test:
[PHP Travels Demo](http://phptravels.com/demo.php/ "PHP Travels Demo")
[Automation Practice](http://automationpractice.com/index.php "Automation Practice")
[Demo QA](http://demoqa.com/ "Demo QA")

# Second
*Start exploring your donor*

Let's focus on first one - PHP Travels Demo
```javascript
const selenium = require("selebium-webdriver");
const By = selenium.By;

const driver = new selenium.Builder().forBrowser("chrome").build();

driver.get("http://phptravels.com/demo.php/");
#Finding element by link text
driver.findElement(By.linkText("Contact Us"));
#Navigating back and forth and even refresh
driver.navigate().back();
driver.navigate().forward();
driver.navigate().refresh();

#Getting current URL
driver.getCurrentUrl().then(url => console.log(url));
```

# Third
*Start making actions on interface*

*This file is _continiuation of previous snippet_*:
```javascript
const firstElement = driver.findElement(By.css(".featured .row"));

#Make hover on selected element
driver.actions().mouseMove(firstElement).perform();
```

More informations and actions you will find [here](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/lib/actions_exports_ActionSequence.html "Selenium Actions on elements")


# Forth
*Wait for the element - until it loads*

Full docs about *until*  are [here](http://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/lib/until.html "Selenium until library")

# Fifth
*Multiple windows in action*

[Moving between windows](http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp#moving-between-windows-and-frames) is possible due to this doc.

# Sixth
*Dealing with everything that pops up*

[This is how](http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/03_webdriver.jsp#popup-dialogs) you can deal with unwanted alerts and pop-ups

# Seventh
*Iframes, iframes everywhere*

You can also deal with iframes inside pages you're testing - [here's how](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20401394/selecting-nested-iframe-selenium-javascript-node-js)

# Eighth
*Chaining, sequences etc.*

Use the [ActionSequence API](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/javascript/module/selenium-webdriver/index_exports_ActionSequence.html) for when you need to do things that are not possible through the standard WebElement API.
