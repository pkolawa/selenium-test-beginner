# First
*Create your abstract object - it's OOP!*

You can build objects based on ECMAScript

```javascript
class HomePage{
    constructor(driver){    
        this.driver = driver;
    }
}

#If you import this file, you can export this object
module.exports = HomePage;
```

To include this file, you must import in main test script:
```javascript
const HomePage = require('./examples/home');
```

Now you've got to initialize, here's whole file since you moved methods into HomePage object in separate files:
```javascript
const selenium = require("selenium-webdriver");
const By = selenium.By;
const HomePage = require("./examples/home");

const driver = new selenium.Builder.forBrowser("chrome").build();

#Create an instance
const homePage = new HomePage(driver);
#Method based on declared in object HomePage
homePage.open();

const texts = [
    "Another text",
    "And another text"
];
texts.forEach(homepage.addAnotherText, homePage);
homePage.clickItem("TEXT IN SPAN");
```
